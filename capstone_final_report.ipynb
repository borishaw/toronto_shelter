However, after extensive feature engineering, the data set contains enough features (daily temperature, daylight length, etc.) to be treated a non-time series problem. When dealing with relatively large amount of features, it is more efficient to take the non-time series approach since the autoregression itself is not very accurate in predicting long term result let alone combining with other features."
